## üì• Installation Guide for Non-Coders

This guide is for anyone who wants to install the app directly on their Android phone without any coding.

### Step 1: Download the App File
1.  Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/SoumadeepChoudhury/DoIt/releases) section of this GitHub page (you're probably here already!).
2.  Under the "Assets" dropdown of the latest release, you will find a file named `app-release.apk`.
3.  Tap on the `.apk` file to download it to your phone. Your browser may warn you about this type of file; this is normal. Proceed with the download.

### Step 2: Allow Installation from Unknown Sources
Since you are installing the app directly and not from the Google Play Store, you need to give your phone permission.
1.  Open your phone's **Settings**.
2.  Go to **Apps & Notifications** (or just **Security** on some phones).
3.  Look for and enable **Install unknown apps** or **Unknown sources**.
4.  You will be asked to which app you want to give this permission (e.g., Chrome, Files). Select the app you used to download the `.apk` file.

### Step 3: Install the App
1.  Open your **Files** or **Downloads** app.
2.  Find the `app-release.apk` file you just downloaded.
3.  Tap on the file.
4.  You will see an installation screen. Review the permissions the app requests (it will typically need storage access to manage its own data).
5.  Tap **Install**. Once finished, tap **Done** or **Open**.

**You're all set!** You can now find "DoIt" in your app drawer. You can go back to your Settings and disable "Unknown sources" for security if you wish.
